# What is the Felys programming language?

This is a fan-made programming language of Elysia. The motivation is to create a language where Elysia exists, so regardless of how this language gets developed in the future, there must exist a built-in identifier called `__elysia__` or `——爱莉希雅——`, depending on the language (en/cn) you are coding in. Having this organization is just for myself to manage relevant repositories, but it is also open for people to contribute.
